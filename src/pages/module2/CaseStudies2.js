              a hacker to guess.

            It is common practice for families to use birthdays as their passwords. Although it seems

            </p><br></br>
            <p className="mod-text">
            Take the example of a mother who named her password after the name of her child, and 
            someone who knew the family well was able to uncover what it was.
            </p><br></br>
            <p><strong>
              This example reminds us that even though a birthday is special, it does not make a strong password.

            In some families, everyone uses the same simple password for convenienceâ€”especially among older

            <p className="mod-text">
            Additionally, in a community, several neighbors may share a common password for their online 
            services, and when that password gets guessed, many accounts became at risk.

            This case shows that sharing a weak password can put multiple people in danger.
