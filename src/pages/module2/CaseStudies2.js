            <p className="mod-text">
              Many people, including grandparents and even kids, sometimes choose very simple passwords like "password123". In one case, an elderly man used this common password for his online accounts, and it was quickly guessed by someone trying to steal his personal information. This shows that a password that seems easy to remember can also be easy for others to guess.

            <p className="mod-text">
              It is common for families to use important dates, like birthdays, as passwords because they are easy to remember. However, these dates are often predictable. For example, a mother used her child's birthday as her email password, and it was soon discovered by someone who knew the family well. This example reminds us that even though a birthday is special, it does not make a strong password.

            <p className="mod-text">
              In some families, everyone uses the same simple password for convenienceâ€”especially among older adults who might find it hard to remember many different passwords. In one community, several neighbors shared a common password for their online services, and when that password was guessed, many accounts were at risk. This case shows that sharing a weak password can put multiple people in danger.
